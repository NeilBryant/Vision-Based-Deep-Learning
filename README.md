## Foreword: Robbie Barrat

Over the past few years, there has been a massive increase in large companies using deep learning to accomplish various technical and commercial feats (self driving cars, targeted advertising, voice assistants on smartphones, etc.). For a long time, research and projects involving machine learning have been restricted to well-funded research labs, but recently, and more importantly, there has been an increasingly low bar of entry for anyone to do work with machine learning and its applications.
 
There are getting to be a substantial amount of compelling deep learning projects from regular people who experiment with these things in their free time. For most people wanting to experiment with deep learning; the previous prerequisite of an expensive university education on the topic no longer applies, as there is a large fund of knowledge appearing in the open-source domain. Even if you do want to go beyond the basics of the field, you’ll find that some of the most bleeding-edge machine learning research papers are being published through non-paywalled journals with links to accompanying open-source code, making even the most advanced and newest research available for anyone to learn about and use. In terms of hardware, project’s like “Google Colaboratory” make it free to use the expensive hardware required to train neural networks. The only cost of working with deep learning today is time spent.

Also, people who are working with deep learning during their free time have absolute creative freedom over what they choose to use the technology for, unlike those employed by companies or research teams for a specific purpose. A perfect demonstration of how beneficial this can be is the work of artists using AI / deep learning as an artist’s tool and art medium. A whole new genre of art is being developed through AI, which I personally believe will the next big art movement. Many artists working with AI post their work on Twitter: some examples are myself, Mario Klingemann, Helena Sarin, and Memo Akten (@DrBeef_ , @Quasimondo , @glagolista , and @memotv - respectively). This sort of work could not be possible without the pushes for the increased accessibility of AI, and I doubt a niche like this would ever emerge in a purely corporate setting.

Because of this total freedom of information, along with the freely available tools and programming libraries to practically apply it, there has been an influx of interesting work being done by such a wide range of people. I believe that this book, while broadening the scope of AI literacy to high schoolers, will serve as a great resource to anyone wanting to become acquainted with deep learning, and I hope it will help enable people to do more creative and interesting things with this exciting technology.


## Introduction

We are two students at Henry M. Gunn High School in Palo Alto, CA interested in artificial intelligence and how it will shape our society. AI has proven to be a solution for a wide variety of problems and is clearly a tool of the future. We believe that the next generation has important jurisdiction on this technology, and, thus, should be properly educated on it. Over the last few years, we have been sharing the opportunities given to us by spreading AI literacy in the most accessible ways. Locally, we created a research incubator for high schoolers in the Bay Area to learn from fellow high schoolers about AI, and this year it has brought fifty teens into the world knowing how to shape AI. Through this book, we wish to target a broader audience as well as supplement the material we present in our local lectures. Our goal is to break down the stereotypes surrounding AI by showing that AI is simply a clever blend between mathematics and computer science–not the wizardry it is commonly portrayed as. To be clear, this is by no means a comprehensive set of topics for deep learning, but instead an introduction to the material. We hope to inspire our fellow high schoolers to learn more about AI and perhaps consider it as a pathway for future studies. After all, in just a few decades, AI will likely be related to your career in some form. AI literacy is becoming more important than ever before.
